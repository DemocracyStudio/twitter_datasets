# twitter_datasets
This repository hosts the Twitter datasets collected in Taipei, Tel Aviv and Tallinn, three cities which are the three case studies of my PhD research on Stakeholder Engagement in Smart-City.  I am sharing this datasets in order to offer some possibilities of collaboration around my research methodology explained here : https://bit.ly/2WsaFXE .

Scraping last Tweets mentioning the name of the city in a specific hashtag is a way to get informed of whatâ€™s talked on twitter about my case studies.
#Taipei request resulted in a list of 17,341 tweets, ride up to November 16th, 2013.
#Telaviv request resulted in a list of 17,628 tweets, ride up to September 30th, 2012.
#Tallinn request resulted in a list of 6,299 tweets, ride up to March 13th, 2008.

Each list of City Hashtag is composed of :
- tweetDate
- content
- twitterProfile
- tweetURL
- timestamp
- query
